# CamelotPHP

A PHP wrapper for the [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/) PDF table extraction tool. This package allows you to extract tables from PDF files using Camelot CLI, and return the results as arrays, objects, or JSON.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Extract tables from PDFs using Camelot CLI
- Structured page/table output as PHP array/object
- Automatically handles temp files and directories
- Detailed error handling for:
    - Missing Camelot
    - Missing Ghostscript
    - Invalid input file
- Supports both `lattice` and `stream` parsing modes

---
## Requirements

- **PHP 8.0+**  
  This library requires PHP version 8.0 or higher.

- **Camelot CLI**  
  You must install [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/) (Python) on your system.  
  Make sure the `camelot` command is accessible in your `$PATH`.

- **Ghostscript**  
  Camelot depends on [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) for parsing PDF content.  
  Ensure `gs` is installed and available in your system `$PATH`.

- **PHP Extensions**
  - `ext-json` (for JSON encoding/decoding)

> üí° **Tip**: Run `which camelot` and `which gs` to confirm both binaries are installed and accessible.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
composer require metolabs/camelot-php
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure [`camelot`](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html) and its dependencies like `ghostscript` are installed on your system and available in your `$PATH`.

---

## üß™ Example Usage

```php
use MetoLabs\CamelotPHP\Camelot;

$camelot = Camelot::make('/path/to/file.pdf', 'lattice');

$result = $camelot->extract('array');

// Output example:
print_r($result['pages'][0]['tables'][1]);
```

You can also extract in other formats:

```php
$camelot->extract('string'); // returns JSON string
$camelot->extract('object'); // returns stdClass object
```

---

## üß∞ Configuration

You can optionally pass:
- Output path (defaults to a temporary directory)
- Custom binary path to `camelot`
- Debug mode (to print command + outputs)

```php
$camelot = Camelot::make('/file.pdf', 'stream', null, '/usr/local/bin/camelot', true);
```
